AllJoyn Thin Client Core Library: Version 14.06 Beta Release Notes
==================================================================

Platform Support
----------------
1) Linux Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (32 and 64 bit)
2) Windows 7 (32 and 64 bit)
3) Windows 8 (32 and 64 bit)


Features added in Version 14.06 Beta
------------------------------------
* Tight integration of the About functionality 
* Security 2.0 and removal of old mechanisms of authentication.
* Next Generation Name Service support: "Who Implements" query is
  supported: this provides the ability to discover peers that implement
  specific interfaces - similar to About Client functionality.
* WMI SPI Layer (WSL) for Thin Library: Implementation to allow Arduino
  Due running with an RTOS (example for FreeRTOS) to work with the
  Arrow/Netcom GT202 IoE WiFi module.


Issues Addressed in Version 14.06 Beta
--------------------------------------
ASACORE-53   Typo in thin library NVRAM constant
ASACORE-143  Implement aj_realloc for thin library
ASACORE-145  liballjoyn_about.a binary compatibility for objective C
ASACORE-173  About bus objects are not announced
ASACORE-204  AboutIcon's Device Icon is incorrectly named in ajtcl
ASACORE-213  About iOS SDK: missing API ('SetDeviceName' with language)
ASACORE-224  AJTCL Linux port needs a larger transmit buffer
ASACORE-264  AllJoynFramework_iOS: add missing files to project
ASACORE-491  DBUS.Properties.GetAll method bypasses interface security
ASACORE-507  Bus name not updated in RN, therefore join session fails
ASACORE-561  Thin Client needs an API to get the routing nodes protocol
	     version
ASACORE-629  Thin library samples need to handle routing node exit gracefully
ASACORE-638  aj_helper.c should ignore unknown messages


Known Issues in Version 14.06 Beta
----------------------------------
ASACORE-46   AJ Thin Client applications that use AJ_StartClient() do not
             know the full bus name of the service that was joined for
             sending method calls.
ASACORE-192  Overlapping ADDMATCH rules should not fetch previously
             received Sessionless signals again. 
ASACORE-305  WSL boot delays are a bit too long
ASACORE-309  WSL power consumption may be too high while sleeping: The WSL
             code doesn't tell the WiFi hardware to go into low-power modes
             when a sleep is requested.
ASACORE-624  AJ_PrintXML(AppObjects) does not prints all the objects that
             are present

Compatibility
-------------
Starting in Version 14.06
* The APIs for About in the core/about_tcl repo are DEPRECATED
* Thin Library protocol version changed from 8 to 9.
* New function AJ_StartClientByInterface which adds support for new NGNS
  features
* Thin Client accepts connection to the routing node based on protocol
  version. When connecting to a pre-14.06 (protocol version < 9) routing
  node you must use the functions AJ_StartClient or AJ_StartService
  otherwise the thin client will reject the connection. Using the NGNS
  function AJ_StartClientByInterface will only allow you to connect to a
  14.06 routing node (protocol version > 9).

Starting in Version 14.02
* Thin Client now negotiates AllJoyn protocol version with routing node
  (version 8).
* AJ_Connect has been deprecated in favor of AJ_FindBusAndConnect.
* Renamed AJ_BusSetSignalRule2 to AJ_BusAddSignalRule
* Removed functions AJ_StartService2 and AJ_StartClient2.
* Added parameter <connected> to AJ_StartService and AJ_StartClient
