AllJoyn Thin Core Library: Version 14.06a Release Notes
=======================================================

Platform Support
----------------
1) Linux Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (32 and 64 bit)
2) Windows 7 (32 and 64 bit)
3) Windows 8 (32 and 64 bit)


Features added in Version 14.06a
--------------------------------
* Tight integration of the About functionality 
* Security enhancements to support future Security 2.0 feature and removal
  of old mechanisms of authentication. 
* Next Generation Name Service support: "Who Implements" query is
  supported: this provides the ability to discover peers that implement
  specific interfaces - similar to About Client functionality.
* WMI SPI Layer (WSL) for Thin Library: Implementation to allow Arduino
  Due running with an RTOS (example for FreeRTOS) to work with the
  Arrow/Netcom GT202 IoE WiFi module.


Issues Addressed in Version 14.06a
----------------------------------
ASACORE-53   Typo in thin library NVRAM constant
ASACORE-143  Implement aj_realloc for thin library
ASACORE-145  liballjoyn_about.a binary compatibility for objective C
ASACORE-173  About bus objects are not announced

ASACORE-507  Bus name not updated in RN, therefore join session fails
ASACORE-561  Thin Client needs an API to get the routing nodes protocol
	     version
ASACORE-624  AJ_PrintXML(AppObjects) does not prints all the objects that
             are present
ASACORE-629  Thin library samples need to handle routing node exit gracefully
ASACORE-638  aj_helper.c should ignore unknown messages
ASACORE-800  Memory leak in auth exchange in case incorrect creds are
             passed to thin library
ASACORE-805  WSL Receive Signal Data Failure
ASACORE-908  Guid Exchange fails between Android Client and Rn node of TCL
             device After factory reset.
ASACORE-912  Set the default minimum protocol version in TCL to 10
ASACORE-924  AJTCL version requires fourth component

Known Issues in Version 14.06a
-----------------------------
ASACORE-46   AJ Thin Client applications that use AJ_StartClient() do not
             know the full bus name of the service that was joined for
             sending method calls.
ASACORE-305  WSL boot delays are a bit too long
ASACORE-309  WSL power consumption may be too high while sleeping: The WSL
             code doesn't tell the WiFi hardware to go into low-power modes
             when a sleep is requested
ASACORE-703  Thin clients occasionally having problems rediscovering
             routing node 
ASACORE-730  Too many NOC messages bog down TCL applications

Compatibility
-------------
Starting in Version 14.06a
No changes.

Starting in Version 14.06
* The APIs for About in the core/about_tcl repo are DEPRECATED
* Thin Library protocol version changed from 9 to 10.
* New function AJ_StartClientByInterface which adds support for new NGNS
  features
* Thin Client accepts connection to the routing node (RN) based on protocol
  version. When connecting to a pre-14.06 (protocol version < 10) routing
  node you must use the functions AJ_StartClient or AJ_StartService
  otherwise the thin client will reject the connection. Using the NGNS
  function AJ_StartClientByInterface will only allow you to connect to a
  14.06 RN (protocol version > 9).
* The change in authentication protocol results in the following
  incompatibilities (these were discussed and approved by the AllSeen TSC
  on May 5. 2014):
  * A 14.06 TCL Application cannot connect with 14.02 TCL App if the
    interaction requires the use of a secured interface
  * 14.06 TCL App cannot use a 14.02 RN that requires authentication.  The
    default configuration file on all platforms for 14.02 RNs requires TC
    nodes to authenticate (this is no longer true in 14.06).  For
    stand-alone RNs this is easily changed via the configuration file,
    while for bundled configurations this requires that the configuration
    in the code be modified.  Another way to mitigate this is for the TCL
    App developer to apply the following patch:
    https://git.allseenalliance.org/gerrit/#/c/2135/
    The patch implements a blacklist of RNs that cannot be connected to
    because of authentication failures or version incompatibility.

Starting in Version 14.02
* Thin Client now negotiates AllJoyn protocol version with routing node
  (version 8).
* AJ_Connect has been deprecated in favor of AJ_FindBusAndConnect.
* Renamed AJ_BusSetSignalRule2 to AJ_BusAddSignalRule
* Removed functions AJ_StartService2 and AJ_StartClient2.
* Added parameter <connected> to AJ_StartService and AJ_StartClient
