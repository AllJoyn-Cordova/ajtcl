/**

/**
 * An interface description is a NULL terminated array of strings. The first string is the interface
 * name. The subsequent strings are a compact representation of the members of the interface. In
 * this representation special characters encode information about the members, whitespace is
 * significant.
 *
 * If the first character of the interface name is a '$' character this indicates that the interface
 * is secure and only authenticated peers can make method calls and received signals defined in the
 * interface.  If the first character of the interface name is a '#' character this indicates that
 * security is not applicable to this interface even if the interface is implemented by an otherwise
 * secure object. The '$' and '#' characters are merely signifiers and are not part of the interface
 * name.
 *
 * The first character of a member string identifies the type of member:
 *
 * A '?' character indicates the member is a METHOD
 * A '!' character indicates the member is a SIGNAL
 * A '@' character indicates the member is a PROPERTY
 *
 * The type character is a signifier, it is not part of the member name. Characters following the
 * member type character up to the end of the string or to the first space character comprise the
 * member names. If the member is a METHOD or SIGNAL the remaining characters encode the argument
 * names, direction (IN or OUT) and the argument type as a standard AllJoyn signature string. For
 * SIGNALS for correctness the direction should be specified as OUT but it really doesn't matter as
 * the direction is ignored.
 *
 * Arguments are separated by a single space character. Argument names are optional and if present are
 * all characters between the space character and the directions character. All characters after the
 * direction character up to the next space or the end of the string are the argument type. The
 * argument direction is specified as follows:
 *
 * A '>' character indicates the argument is an OUT parameter.
 * A '<' character indicates the argument is an IN parameter.
 *
 * If the member is a PROPERTY the member name is terminated by an access rights character which is
 * immediately followed by the property type signature. The access rights for a property are
 * READ_ONLY, WRITE_ONLY and READ_WRITE. The access rights are specified as follows:
 *
 * A '>' character indicates the argument is READ_ONLY  (i.e. an OUT parameter)
 * A '<' character indicates the argument is WRITE_ONLY (i.e. an IN parameter)
 * A '=' character indicates the argument is READ/WRITE
 *

   static const char* const ExampleInterface[] = {
    "org.alljoyn.example",                  // The interface name
    "?StringPing inStr<s outStr>",          // A method called StringPing with an IN arg and OUT arg of type string
    "?Hello",                               // A method call with no arguments
    "?Add <i <i >i",                        // A method call that takes two integers and returns an integer. The args are not named
    "!ListChanged >a{ys}",                  // A signal that returns a dictionary
    "@TimeNow>(yyy)",                       // A READ_ONLY property that returns a struct with three 8 bit integers
    "@Counter=u",                           // A READ/WRITE property
    "@SecretKey<ay",                        // A WRITE_ONLY property that sets an array of bytes
    NULL                                    // End marker
