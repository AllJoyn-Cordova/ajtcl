This code statically links to code available from http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/
and that code is subject to a license agreement with terms and conditions that you will
be responsible for from STMicroelectronics if you employ that code. Use of such code is
your responsibility. Neither AllSeen Alliance nor any contributor to this AllSeen code
base has any obligations with respect to the STMicroelectronics code that to which you
will be statically linking this code. One requirement in the license is that the
STMicroelectronics code may only be used with STMicroelectronics processors as set forth
in their agreement.

The board support package (BSP) for the STM32 is provided untested and is intended
for the community to develop and better. It is NOT an officially supported platform
for the WSL driver or any other AllJoyn component. If you have a desire to use this
BSP you are welcome to do so, but there may be bugs, and there will be limited support.
If problems are found with this BSP it would be helpful if that problem could be
communicated to the AllJoyn community, or better yet if fixes are provided as
contributions to the project, as the intent is to keep this under active development.
